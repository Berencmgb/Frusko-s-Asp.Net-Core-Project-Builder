# Frusko's Asp.Net Core Solution Builder

Welcome to Frusko's ASP.NET Core Solution Builder. This tool will create a asp.net core solution for you to start your projects with. Simply run the console library, 
input your solution name and where you'd like to save and let the tool work it's magic. This will produce a web project for your front-end, along with an API back-end 
to allow for saving to an SQL database.

## Known Issues
- Sometimes the API host url will hang. Not sure what causes this. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. If this isn't working for you, select 'n' when the tool asks if you want to generate the api host url.
